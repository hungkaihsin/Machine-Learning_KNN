# Machine Learning - KNN

## Introduction
- This is a simple example of practicing the use of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in Python.
- `Assignment1.ipynb` includes KNN without VDM.

- `Assignment2.ipynb` includes KNN with VDM.

- The files `AssignmentKNN1.pdf` and `AssignmentKNN2_Logistic.pdf` contain the requirements for this practice.

- For more details about KNN, please visit [this page](https://hackmd.io/@hungkaihsin/ByiBK0Mtkg).

- For the Logistic Regression section, please visit [my GitHub](https://github.com/hungkaihsin/Machine-Learning_Logistic_Regression) and [this page](https://hackmd.io/@hungkaihsin/rkUmkaun1l) for more details.

Special thanks to Professor Anahita and the MS Data Science program for providing an excellent learning environment in the field of Machine Learning.
